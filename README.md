This assignment is all about the key concept of Data Engineering


Question 1

Research and compare two popular cloud service providers and their
offerings for data engineering. Analyze the features, pricing models, and
scalability options provided by each platform.

Comparison of cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure
can be done based on factors like pricing, scalability options, data storage services (e.g., S3,
Azure Blob Storage), and compute services (e.g., AWS EMR, Azure HDInsight).

Question 2

Select a real-world use case that exemplifies each of the 5Vs (Volume,
Velocity, Variety, Veracity, Value) of big data. Explain how data engineering
techniques can be applied to address the challenges and opportunities
associated with each V.

Examples showcasing the 5Vs of big data can include social media data (Volume), real-time
sensor data (Velocity), unstructured data like text and images (Variety), data quality and
reliability issues (Veracity), and business insights and value generation (Value).

Question 3

Analyze a real-world business case and propose a hybrid solution that
combines OLTP and OLAP systems to meet both transactional and analytical
data processing requirements. Justify your solution and discuss potential
benefits and challenges.

A hybrid solution combining OLTP and OLAP databases can involve extracting relevant data
from an OLTP database, and transforming and loading it into an OLAP database for analysis. This
can facilitate near-real-time reporting while preserving transactional integrity.

Question 4

Explain the key differences between a traditional relational database, a
data warehouse, and a data lake. When would you recommend using
each of these storage solutions in a data engineering project?

The main differences between a traditional database, data warehouse, and data lake lie in their
data models, data storage approaches, data schemas, and data processing capabilities. Use
cases for each can be identified based on factors such as data structure, data volume, and
analytical requirements

Question 5

Discuss the advantages and challenges of ETL in the context of data
engineering.
